## Static files

A Web Component is a self-contained native component that runs within a shadowed scope in the DOM.  
For the same reason, it is rather incovenient to bundle static files with the Web Component itself.  
In order to use images or graphic, there are two options:

- **Serve the images, and reference it in a url**: `<img src="https://some-cloud/some-image.png" />`
- **Use SVG**: You can import SVG-files into the component. React will render these as SVG Elements inside the React App instead of loading them at runtime.

## Serve

For development, you can serve the bundle file.  
Simply start the dev-server by using

```console
npm start
```

The bundle will be served on: `http://localhost:3000/direflowBundle.js`

## Chunking

When you build your Direflow Components, you can optionally pass in a vendor argument:

```console
npm run build --vendor
```

This will create a build folder containing two bundle-files:

```
.
└── build
    ├── direflowBundle.js
    └── vendor.js
```

`direflowBundle.js`: Will contain all source-code.  
`vendor.js`: Will contain all third-party packages.

To split your bundle into a chunk per Direflow Component, use the split argument.

```console
npm run build --split
```

This will create a build folder containing a bundle-file per Direflow Component.

```
.
└── build
    ├── main.js
    ├── coolComponent.js
    └── awesomeComponent.js
```

The `main.js` file will contain the code in your _main_ `index.js` file.  
If the _main_ `index.js` file is empty, the `main.js` file can be excluded.

Additionally, you can combine both:

```console
npm run build --vendor --split
```

To get:

```
.
└── build
    ├── main.js
    ├── vendor.js
    ├── coolComponent.js
    └── awesomeComponent.js
```

## Renaming bundle-files

You have the option to rename the bundlefiles.
Go the `direflow-webpack.js` and pass in the desired filename as and option.

You can rename the main bundle file, the vendor bundle file or both.

```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env, { filename: 'myBundle.js', chunkFilename: 'thirdParty.js' });
});
```

> ⚠️ This does not work using the `--split` option.

## Provide your own React and ReactDOM modules
If you want to provide your own React and ReactDOM modules, add the urls in the `direflow-webpack.js` file:
```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env, {
    react: 'https://your-custom-cdn.com/react.js',
    reactDOM: 'https://your-custom-cdn.com/react-dom.js',
  })
});
```

## Shadow DOM

The Web Component will run inside a shadow DOM.  
However, sometimes that's not really what we want.

In order to disable the shadow-root entirely, simply set the `useShadow` property to `false` in the configuration.

```javascript
// src/cool-component/index.js
DireflowComponent.create({
  component: App,
  configuration: {
    tagname: 'cool-component',
    useShadow: false,
  },
});
```

## IE 11 Support

In order to support IE 11, you will need to import the necessary polyfills.

Start by installing

```console
npm install abortcontroller-polyfill proxy-polyfill
```

Now add the polyfills to the very top of your index.js or index.tsx file

```javascript
// Add these polyfills for ie 11
import 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';
import 'react-app-polyfill/stable';
import 'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/abortcontroller-polyfill-only';
import 'proxy-polyfill';

import { DireflowComponent } from 'direflow-component';
import App from './App';

export default DireflowComponent.create({
  component: App,
  configuration: {
    tagname: 'cool-component',
  },
});
```

If you want to use IE 11 during development, add 'IE 11' to `browserlist` under `development` in `package.json`

```json
"browserslist": {
  "production": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not op_mini all"
  ],
  "development": [
    "last 1 chrome version",
    "last 1 firefox version",
    "last 1 safari version",
    "IE 11" // <- Add this line
  ]
},
```

## Offline support
In order to make the Direflow Components work offline, we need to disable lazyloading of the Web Component polyfills and the React modules.
> ⚠️ Be aware that this will introduce a significantly larger bundle size.

First, we disable lazyloading of `React` and `ReactDOM` dependencies by altering the `direflow-webpack.js` file:
```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env, {
    react: false,
    reactDOM: false,
  })
});
```

Next, we disable lazyloading of the Web Component polyfills by using the `polyfill-loader` plugins:
```javascript
plugins: [
  {
    name: 'polyfill-loader',
    options: {
      use: {
        sd: false,
        ce: false,
        adapter: false
      }
    }
  }
]
```
Add this plugin to any Direflow Component that needs to function offline.

We now want to install these polyfills as a part of the setup:
```console
npm install @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs
```

Then go to your index-file (where you configure the Direflow Components), and **at the very top of the file**, add these imports:
```console
import '@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-bundle.js';
import '@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js';
```
