## Properties and attributes
One of the cool thing about Web Components is that we can pass in data that the Web Component can use.  
There are two ways that we can do that:
- By setting an attribute:
  ```html
  <awesome-component componentTitle="New Title"></awesome-component>
  ```
- Or by setting a property:
  ```javascript
  const component = document.querySelector('awesome-component');
  component.sampleList = ['Create', 'Build', 'Use'],
  ```

When we build our Web Component in React, we want to receive these properties and attributes as *props* to our root component.  
  
To make sure that properties and attributes of the Web Component are passed down to the React App as props, we need to provide Direflow with a set of properties and their initial values.
This is done by passing a set of properties to `DireflowComponent` in `index.js` (or `index.tsx`).

```javascript
const direflowComponent = new DireflowComponent();

const direflowProperties = {
  componentTitle: 'Update Component',
  sampleList: [
    'Create with React',
    'Build as Web Component',
    'Use it anywhere!',
  ],
};

direflowComponent.configure({
  name: 'update-component',
  useShadow: true,
  properties: direflowProperties,
});

direflowComponent.create(App);
```

The Direflow Component will automatically observe changes in the properties provided, and React will update the UI accordingly.
