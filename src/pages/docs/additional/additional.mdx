## Static files
A Web Component is a self-contained native component that runs within a shadowed scope in the DOM.  
For the same reason, it is rather incovenient to bundle static files with the Web Component itself.  
In order to use images or graphic, there are two options:
- **Serve the images, and reference it in a url**: `<img src="https://some-cloud/some-image.png" />`
- **Use SVG**: You can import SVG-files into the component. React will render these as SVG Elements inside the React App instead of loading them at runtime.

## Serve
For development, you can serve the `bundle.js` file.  
Simply start the dev-server by using
```console
yarn start
```
or
```console
npm start
```
This will serve your file on `http://localhost:3000/bundle.js`

## Shadow DOM
The Web Component will run inside a shadow DOM.  
However, sometimes that's not really what we want.  
  
In order to disable the shadow-root entirely, simply pass in an option to the *render* method of ReactWebComponent:
- Go to *index.tsx* or *index.js* inside the *src* folder
- Pass the option `{ shadow: false }` as the third argument of the *render* method:
  ```javascript
  ReactWebComponent.render(App, 'awesome-component', { shadow: false });
  ```

## IE 11 Support
In order to support IE 11, you will need to import the necessary polyfills.  

Start by installing
```console
yarn add abortcontroller-polyfill proxy-polyfill
```
or
```console
npm install abortcontroller-polyfill proxy-polyfill
```

Now add the polyfills to the very top of your index.js or index.tsx file
```javascript
// Add these polyfills for ie 11
import 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';
import 'react-app-polyfill/stable';
import 'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/abortcontroller-polyfill-only';
import 'proxy-polyfill';

import DireflowComponent from 'direflow-component';
import { componentAttributes, componentProperties } from './componentProperties';
import App from './App';

DireflowComponent.setAttributes(componentAttributes);
DireflowComponent.setProperties(componentProperties);
DireflowComponent.render(App, 'awesome-component');
```

If you want to use IE 11 during development, add 'IE 11' to `browserlist` under `development` in `package.json`
```json
"browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version",
      "IE 11" // <- Add this line
    ]
  },
```
