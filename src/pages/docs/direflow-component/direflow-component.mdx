## Direflow Component
With Direflow, you can create a single stand-alone Web Component.  
The component logic is created using React, and the build-step produces a `componentBundle.js` file.  
  
You can choose you write your component in either JavaScript or TypeScript.  

## Setup
When you create a new Direflow Component from `direflow-cli`, you will get a basic setup that looks like this:  
(TypeScript will have a couple of additional files)  

```

|  ├──index.css
|  └──index.html

|  ├──test
|  |  └──App.test.js
|  ├──App.css
|  ├──App.js
|  ├──componentProperties.js
|  └──index.js
├──.env
├──direflow-config.js
├──direflow-webpack.js
├──package.json
└──README.md
```

### index.html
The public folder contains an `index.html` file.  
This is where you consume your Web Component during development.  
  
### direflow-config.js
This file will contain some meta-data about your Direflow Component.  
In this file, we can also add different plugins to the component.  
See more under [plugins](/plugins).

### direflow-webpack.js
This file gives you complete control over the Webpack setup.  
A Direflow Component is using the same configuration as in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but is partially overriden using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).
  
However, this file offers the ability to further override any of the Webpack config that ships with Direflow.  
Simply add an override after the first line:
```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env),
  // Add your own webpack config here (optional)
});
```

### componentProperties.js
The `src` folder will look more or less identical to the one you get when using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
There are a couple of differences.  
  
The `index.js` file will look different since we are using `DireflowComponent` to render a Web Component, instead of `ReactDOM` to mount our application to the DOM.  
  
You will also find a file called `componentProperties.js`.  
This will is used to register attributes and properties that you would want your component to listen and react to.  
Read more about [properties and attributes](/properties-and-attributes).

## Developing
During development of your Direflow Component, you can start the component on development server by running
```console
yarn start
```
or
```console
npm start
```

## Build
Build your Direflow Component by running the command
```console
yarn build
```
or 
```console
npm run build
```

This will create a `/build` folder containing a `componentBundle.js` file.  
In order to use your Web Component, simply import this file in a project, and use your Web Component as:
```html
<script src="./componentBundle.js"></script>

<awesome-component componentTitle="Awesome Component">
</awesome-component>
```
