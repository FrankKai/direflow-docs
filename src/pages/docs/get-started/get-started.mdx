## Install CLI
Start by installing direflow-CLI
```console
npm i -g direflow-cli
```

## Create new Direflow Setup
Now, use this command to create a new Direflow Setup
```console
direflow create
```
Now you can choose a name for your setup and a prefered language. Currently both JavaScript and TypeScript is supported.  
A folder will be created at your current location.  
  
Now, cd into your new project and use the following commands
```console
cd <project-folder>
yarn install
yarn start
```
Your Direflow Setup will start running on `localhost:3000` and your browser opens a new window  
<br />
<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <base-component></base-component>
</p>

<br />
<br />

## The Setup
When you create a new Direflow Setup from `direflow-cli`, you will get a basic setup that looks like this:  
(TypeScript will have a couple of additional files)  

```
.
├── public
│  ├── index.css
│  └── index.html
├── src
│  ├── direflow-component
│  │   ├── test
│  │   │   └── App.test.js
│  │   ├── App.css
│  │   └── App.js
│  └── index.js
├── direflow-config.js
├── direflow-webpack.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

The setup will look close to the one you get when using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
However, there are a couple of differences. 

### index.html
The public folder contains an `index.html` file.  
This is where you consume your Web Component during development.  

### index.js
In the `index.js` file, the React App is mounted as a Web Component using the `DireflowComponent` instance.  
```javascript
import DireflowComponent from 'direflow-component';
import App from './direflow-component/App';

const direflowComponent = new DireflowComponent();
direflowComponent.render(App, 'awesome-component');
```

In this file you can configure your Web Component.  
As a default, the Web Component will be given the same name as your Direflow Setup, but you can easily rename it in the `render()` method.

### direflow-config.js
This file will contain some meta-data about your Direflow Setup.  
In this file, we can also add different plugins to the setup.  
See more under [plugins](/plugins).

### direflow-webpack.js
This file gives you complete control over the Webpack setup.  
A Direflow Setup is using the same configuration as in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but is partially overriden using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).
  
However, this file offers the ability to further override any of the Webpack config that ships with Direflow.  
Simply add an override after the first line:
```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env),
  // Add your own webpack config here (optional)
});
```

## Multiple Web Components
As default, the Direflow Setup comes with one Direflow Component out-of-the-box.  
This component is found in the folder `direflow-component`.  
  
Creating multiple Web Components in the same Direflow Setup is easy!  
Create a new folder next to `direflow-component` and let that contain another React App.  
Now simply create a new instance of `DireflowComponent` in the `index.js` file like so:  
```javascript
import DireflowComponent from 'direflow-component';
import App from './direflow-component/App';
import AnotherApp from './another-component/AnotherApp';

const direflowComponent = new DireflowComponent();
direflowComponent.render(App, 'awesome-component');

const anotherComponent = new DireflowComponent();
anotherComponent.render(AnotherApp, 'another-component');
```

## Callback when Web Component connects
Some times we want to provide a callback function that is called whenever our Web Component is mounted on the DOM.  
You can provide a callback function to the `DireflowComponent` like this:  
```javascript
const direflowComponent = new DireflowComponent();

direflowComponent.onConnected((component) => {
  // Do something with the component once it's mounted on the DOM.
});

direflowComponent.render(App, 'awesome-component');
```

## Developing
During development of your Direflow Components, you can start the component on development server by running
```console
yarn start
```
or
```console
npm start
```

## Build
Build your Direflow Components by running the command
```console
yarn build
```
or 
```console
npm run build
```

This will create a `/build` folder containing a `direflowBundle.js` file.  
In order to use your Web Component, simply import this file in a project, and use your Web Component as:
```html
<script src="./direflowBundle.js"></script>

<awesome-component></awesome-component>
```
