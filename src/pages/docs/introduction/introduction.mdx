## Why Web Components?
Web Components is a browser standard that was added by WC3 (World Wide Web Consortium).  
They give us all the power that a modular, atomic, component-based design does, but in a framework-agnostic way that enables us to run encapsulated components directly in the browser as custom HTML elements.
  
With Web Components we can consume individual components without depending on any frameworks like React or Angular.
  
In this example we can see how easy it is to use a Web Component

  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

## Why React?
Even though Web Components can be built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, it's pretty handy to use a library like React to build the UI.  
React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building UIs and single-page application, and is well known for its fast performance and easy-to-learn nature.

## Why Direflow?
With Direflow, we combine the best of two worlds!  
    
Direflow allows us to build rich, declarative micro-applications using React, and then ship it as a custom element that run natively in the browser!
It's powered by react-scripts from create-react-app, and is built using the Web Components standard.

**Some of the features of Direflow include:**  

✔️ Create, build and ship Web Components easier than ever before  
✔️ Configure your project with full Webpack control  
✔️ Bundling multiple components together for optimized bundlesize  
✔️ Data-sharing and interactions between components  
✔️ Plugins for varies purposes: font-loading, external resources, styled-components, and more ...
