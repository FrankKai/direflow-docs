## Why Web Components?
Web Components is a browser standard that was added by WC3 (World Wide Web Consortium).  
They give us all the power that a modular, atomic, component-based design does, but in a framework-agnostic way that enables us to run encapsulated components directly in the browser as custom HTML elements.
  
With Web Components you can build, deploy, share and consume individual components without depending on any frameworks like React or Angular.
  
In this example you can see how easy it is to use a Web Component
<iframe height="450" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="gOOLbmV" src="https://codepen.io/Silind/embed/gOOLbmV?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

## Why React?
Even though Web Components can be build entirely with vanilla JavaScript, it's pretty handy to use a library like React to build the UI.  
  
Direflow allows you to build rich, declarative UI's, and then ship it as a custom element that can run natively in the browser! ðŸ’ª

Here we have two crypto currency widgets that are fetching live data and interacting with each other:
