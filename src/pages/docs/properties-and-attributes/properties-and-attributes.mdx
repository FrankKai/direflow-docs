## Properties and attributes
One of the cool thing about Web Components is that we can pass in data that the Web Component can use.  
There are two ways that we can do that:
- By setting an attribute:
  ```html
  <awesome-component componentTitle="New Title"></awesome-component>
  ```
- Or by setting a property:
  ```javascript
  const component = document.querySelector('awesome-component');
  component.sampleList = ['Create component', 'Build  it', 'Deploy it'];
  ```

When we build our Web Component in React, we want to receive these properties and attributes as *props* to our root component.  
  
To make sure that properties and attributes of the Web Component is passed down to the React App as props, we need to register the properties and attributes.

To register properties and attributes for the Web Component, go to:
- `src/properties.ts` (if you are using **TypeScript**)
- `src/properties.js` (if you are using **JavaScript**)

Update the object `properties` with the names of your *properties* as the key, and an initial value:
```javascript
const properties = {
  sampleList: [
    'Create',
    'Build',
    'Share',
  ],
};
```
  
Likewise, update the object `attributes` with the names of your *attributes* as the key, and an initial value:
```javascript
const attributes = {
  componentTitle: 'Awesome Web Component',
};
```

If you are using **TypeScript**, you will also have to update the interfaces `Iproperties` and `Iattributes` to reflect the *types* of the properties and attributes.  
Remember - attributes can only consist of primitive types! String, number, boolean, etc.

```typescript
interface Iproperties {
  sampleList: string[];
}

interface Iattributes {
  componentTitle: string;
}
```

Similarly, if you are using **JavaScript**, you should update the *PropTypes* to reflect the *types* of the properties and attributes.
```javascript
const propTypes = {
  sampleList: PropTypes.array,
  componentTitle: PropTypes.string,
};
```
