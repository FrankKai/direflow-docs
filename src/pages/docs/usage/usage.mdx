## Build
Build your component by running the command
```console
yarn build
```
or 
```console
npm run build
```

This will create a `/build` folder containing a file with the name of your component, e.g. `bundle.js`.  
In order to use your Web Component, simply import this file in a project, and use your Web Component as:
```html
<awesome-component componentTitle="Awesome Component">
</awesome-component>
```

## Static files
A Web Component is a self-contained native component that runs within a shadowed scope in the DOM.  
For the same reason, it is rather incovenient to bundle static files with the Web Component itself.  
In order to use images or graphic, there are two options:
- **Serve the images, and reference it in a url**: `<img src="https://some-cloud/some-image.png" />`
- **Use SVG**: You can import SVG-files into the component. React will render these as SVG Elements inside the React App instead of loading them at runtime.

## Serve
For development, you can serve the `bundle.js` file.  
Simply start the dev-server by using
```console
yarn start
```
or
```console
npm start
```
This will serve your file on `http://localhost:3000/bundle.js`

## Shadow DOM
The Web Component will run inside a shadow DOM.  
However, sometimes that's not really what we want.  
  
In order to disable the shadow-root entirely, simply pass in an option to the *render* method of ReactWebComponent:
- Go to *index.tsx* or *index.js* inside the *src* folder
- Pass the option `{ shadow: false }` as the third argument of the *render* method:
  ```javascript
  ReactWebComponent.render(App, 'awesome-component', { shadow: false });
  ```
